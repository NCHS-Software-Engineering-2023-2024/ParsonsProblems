# Overview
Parsons problems are a type of draggable code puzzle, where the user rearranges the code blocks to arrange functioning code. 
Users not logged in should be able to do a parsons puzzle and load a puzzle either from the (global) database or import one from local files. 
Users logged in (authorized as teachers) should be able to save puzzles to the database and edit them.
