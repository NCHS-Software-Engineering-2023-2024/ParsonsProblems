*2024 Software Engineering 2's Parsons Puzzlers
Celeste Emery ('24), Seth Tan ('23), Aryan Pradhan ('23), and Andrew Bukowski ('23)*

## Overview
Parsons problems are a type of draggable code puzzle, where the user rearranges the code blocks to arrange functioning code. 
Users, as of this build of NCHS Parsons Problems, can:
1. Solve a default parsons problem on the homepage
2. Upload custom problems (via local files, including .txt, .java, and .py) to solve as a parsons problem
3. Navigate and select problems from a database of previously uploaded problems
4. Upload custom problems (via local files) to the database for other users to use

## Platform Requirements
Frontend & backend both require React installed. 
Optionally, use Github Codespaces to code on the browser (useful for Chromebooks). *However, Github Codespaces gives a 'failed to fetch' error when trying to access the database. We think this is an issue with routing, since Codespaces redirects ports to a custom domain (ie. not "http://localhost/...")*
